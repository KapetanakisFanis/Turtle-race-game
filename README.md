# Turtle-race-game

The turtle race app is a simple guessing game where the player tries to guess which turtle will finish first. For graphics and dialog windows, turtle graphics and PyAutoGUI 0.9.53 package were used from the following links: https://docs.python.org/3/library/turtle.html and https://pypi.org/search/?q=pyautogui
For more details read the turtle graphics documentation from the following link https://docs.python.org/3/library/turtle.html

Initially, a window 500X400 pixels is created. The player is asked which turtle he thinks it will win and writes the color of the turtle. Then, eight turtles are placed vertically in the window on the y-axis and the race begins. Whichever turtle finishes first, the user is informed if he wins and the game ends. Below some instants of the game are presented.
